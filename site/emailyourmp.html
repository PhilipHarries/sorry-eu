        <h1>Email your MP</h1>
        <p>Feel free to copy and edit the email that I sent to my MP, below.  You can find your MP's email address <a href=http://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/contact-your-mp/>here</a> or send a message online <a href=https://www.writetothem.com>here</a>.  Be sure to include your address!  It's not quite true to say that MPs only care about constituents that can vote for (or against) them...  (but it's a bit true)</p>
        <p><b>Please oppose Britain leaving the EU in Parliament</b></p>
        <p>For the attention of The Right Honorable [your mp], MP,</p>
	<p>Dear [your mp],</p>
	<p>I understand that you number amongst the MPs that favour Britain leaving the European Union.  I am afraid that I number amongst the [<a href=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/elections-and-referendums/upcoming-elections-and-referendums/eu-referendum/electorate-and-count-information>find your result here</a>]% of your constituents who disagree with your position.</p>
        <p>I am writing to you to request that you support any motion in Parliament that opposes Britain leaving the EU, that you oppose any vote to trigger article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and that you support any vote for a second referendum on Britain leaving the EU.  In particular, I ask that you support the motion to be brought by The Right Honorable David Lammy MP (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-result-latest-david-lammy-mp-eu-referendum-result-parliament-twitter-statement-stop-this-a7102931.html).</p>
	<p>I do not deny that I have been in part energised by horror at the result that has been returned.  But disappointment is not itself sufficient reason to feel that a second referendum should be called.  I greatly favour proportional representation, but never considered that there should be a second referendum on that issue.  I feel, and I hope that you agree or may be persuaded, that firstly, the British people were underinformed and misinformed on the issues in front of them, and that secondly, popular sentiment since the referendum has already moved so significantly that a second referendum - if taken today - would return a different result.  This second point is of great significance - for if the MPs sitting in Parliament were to vote contrary to the referendum result, they could honestly argue they reflect the will of the people.</p>
	<p>This is a pivotal moment in British history, perhaps world history.  A 52-48 split in public opinion, now questionable, cannot be considered a sufficient mandate.</p>
	<p>Please reflect the will of the people of [your constituency] and oppose any vote in Parliament for Britain to leave the EU.</p>
	<p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
	<p>[your name here]</p>
	<p>[your address here]</p>
