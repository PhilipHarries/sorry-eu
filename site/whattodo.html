        <p>Is there anything that can be done to stop Brexit?</p>
        <h1>What can we do?</h1>
        <h2>"But the public have voted - that's the end of it"</h2>
        <p>It's important to realise that a referendum is a large and expensive undertaking, that there is no reason to believe that the results were miscounted, and so it has to be accepted that a majority (by over a million people) of voters in the referendum voted to leave the EU.  However, there are a number of reasons to believe that people were not fully informed, and that a second referendum would yield a substantially different result.</p>
       <p>The reasons for believing there might be a different result are:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Lies from the Leave Campaign
           <ul>
             <img alt="£350 million per week for the NHS, control our borders" src=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cl720fDUoAEIGFj.jpg:small>

               <ul>
                 <li>"intense and intensifying European cooperation and partnership in a huge number of fields: the arts, the sciences, the universities, and on improving the environment"</li>
                 <li>"EU citizens living in this country will have their rights fully protected, and the same goes for British citizens living in the EU"</li>
                 <li>"British people will still be able to go and work in the EU; to live; to travel; to study; to buy homes and to settle down"</li>
                 <li>"The only change [...] is that the UK will extricate itself from the EU's [...] system of legislation"  (i.e. the European Court of Justice)</li>
               </ul>
             </li>
             <li>And it's not just the campaigns alone, <a href=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/26/people-spoken-brexit-did-media-tell-the-truth-eu-referendum?CMP=fb_gu>there are serious questions to be asked about the media's role in informing the public about the EU and Brexit's consequences</a></li>

         </li>
       </ul>
        <h2>So get on with it - what can we do?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href=http://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/contact-your-mp/>Contact your MP</a>
            <ul>
              <li>It doesn't matter whether your MP is pro Brexit or against - they represent <b>you</b> - certainly it may feel incredibly unlikely that they'll pay any attention to what you have to say, but it <i>is</i> their job!</li>
              <li>Let them know what you think, and how you would like them to represent you in Parliament.  If it's just you contacting them, they probably won't do anything, it's true - but if enough people register their opinions, it will have an impact.</li>
              <li>If you're struggling to know what to write <a href=/emailyourmp.html>feel free to copy and edit my email</a>.</li>
              <li>If you don't agree with the idea of a second referendum <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/stop-brexit-mp-vote-referendum-members-parliament-act-europe?CMP=fb_gu>and you're not alone</a> - but still don't like the result, you can still contact your MP and ask that they vote against the government when they attempt to take Britain out of the EU.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Register your opinion with the media
            <ul>
              <li>Write to your paper of choice's letters page, regional and national</li>
              <li>Post on social media (twitter, facebook)</li>
              <li>Call in to radio and tv debates</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Attend <a href=https://www.facebook.com/ReferendumMarch/>a march</a></li>
          <li>Convince a friend</li>
          <li>
            <a href=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/can-mps-block-brexit-david-lammy-tells-parliament-stop-madness-non-binding-vote-1567454>Tell your MP that you would like them to block Brexit in the Houses of Parliament</a>
            <ul>

                <a href=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/jun/26/second-referendum-consequences-brexit-grave>MP David Lammy is backing a vote in Parliament to halt Brexit and call a second referendum</a>
